# Project Title

Adding products using struct
## Description
The "ProductsContract" is a blockchain smart contract that maintains a public mapping called "Products," linking product names to corresponding details through a "Product" struct. The struct captures the product's name, category, and price. The contract includes an initializer setting "Products" as an empty dictionary and a function, "addProduct," allowing for the addition of new products with specified attributes. In essence, it serves as a concise framework for recording and managing product information on the blockchain.
